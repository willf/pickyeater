Simulation of [the Picky Eater riddle](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-solve-the-puzzle-of-the-picky-eater/)

To quote:

>> Every morning, before heading to work, you make a sandwich for lunch using
>> perfectly square bread. But you hate the crust. You hate the crust so much that
>> you’ll only eat the portion of the sandwich that is closer to its center than to
>> its edges so that you don’t run the risk of accidentally biting down on that
>> charred, stiff perimeter. How much of the sandwich will you eat?

The sim says about 25%. The math does too.
